Our method employs semidefinite relaxation in order to recover provably globally optimal solutions of the rotation averaging problem. In contrast to prior work, we show how to solve large-scale instances of these relaxations using manifold minimization on (only slightly) higher-dimensional rotation manifolds, re-using existing high-performance (but local) structure-from-motion pipelines. Our method thus preserves the speed and scalability of current SFM methods, while recovering globally optimal solutions.",

	abstract="A popular approach to detect outliers in a data set is to find the largest consensus set, that is to say maximizing the number of inliers and estimating the underlying model. RANSAC is the most widely used method for this aim but is non-deterministic and does not guarantee to return the optimal solution. In this paper, we consider a rotation model and we present a new approach that performs consensus set maximization in a mathematically guaranteed globally optimal way. We solve the problem by a branch-and-bound framework associated with a rotation space search. Our mathematical formulation can be applied for various computer vision tasks such as panoramic image stitching, 3D registration with a rotating range sensor and line clustering and vanishing point estimation. Experimental results with synthetic and real data sets have successfully confirmed the validity of our approach.",

To demonstrate the capacity of GloMIQO, we extensively tested its performance on a test suite of 399 problems of diverse size and structure. The test cases are taken from process networks applications, computational geometry problems, GLOBALLib, MINLPLib, and the Bonmin test set. We compare the performance of GloMIQO with respect to four state-of-the-art global optimization solvers: BARON 10.1.2, Couenne 0.4, LindoGLOBAL 6.1.1.588, and SCIP 2.1.0.},

	abstract={This paper introduces a new algorithmic technique for solving certain problems in geometric computer vision. The main novelty of the method is a branch-and-bound search over rotation space, which is used in this paper to determine camera orientation. By searching over all possible rotations, problems can be reduced to known fixed-rotation problems for which optimal solutions have been previously given. In particular, a method is developed for the estimation of the essential matrix, giving the first guaranteed optimal algorithm for estimating the relative pose using a cost function based on reprojection errors. Recently convex optimization techniques have been shown to provide optimal solutions to many of the common problems in structure from motion. However, they do not apply to problems involving rotations. The search method described in this paper allows such problems to be solved optimally. Apart from the essential matrix, the algorithm is applied to the camera pose problem, providing an optimal algorithm. The approach has been implemented and tested on a number of both synthetically generated and real data sets with good performance.},

In studying the empirical performance, we note that there are few failure cases reported in the literature, in particular for estimation problems with a single rotation, motivating us to gain further theoretical understanding. A general framework based on tools from algebraic geometry is introduced for analyzing the power of semidefinite relaxations of problems with quadratic objective functions and rotational constraints. Applications include registration, hand--eye calibration, and rotation averaging. We characterize the extreme points and show that there exist failure cases for which the relaxation is not tight, even in the case of a single rotation. We also show that some problem classes are always tight given an appropriate parametrization. Our theoretical findings are accompanied with numerical simulations, providing further evidence and understanding of the results.},

	abstract = {Redundant and complementary information from different types of sensors boosts the robustness of autonomous systems, making them more reliable and safer. In particular, inertial measurement units (IMUs) are increasingly being integrated with cameras for that purpose, since the information provided by the IMU helps to simplify some visual problems and improves the accuracy of the results. In the context of estimating the motion of a camera, which is the problem we address in this work, the gravity vector delivers by the IMU reduces the unknown rotation to only one degree of freedom instead of three, hence simplifying the relative pose problem (RPp). Despite this simplification, the RPp is still nonconvex, therefore the quality (optimality) of the solution returned by iterative solvers cannot be guaranteed. These suboptimal solutions may have serious consequences for applications that have this solver as a key block, and may even cause their complete failure. In this paper, we contribute a certifiable solver for the RPp with gravity prior. We propose an iterative certifier that does not assume any condition on the problem, and returns an optimality certification even for an overconstrained formulation with 28 constraints in less than 1.5 milliseconds. Since the certifier doesn't obtain the solution to the problem, we also provide a fast, iterative on-manifold estimation of the relative pose, which is shown to return solutions with lower costs than other nonminimal solvers in less time. We make the code available at https://www.github.com/mergarsal.}

While the problem of minimizing the sum of clipped convex functions is NP-hard, we present some heuristics for approximately solving instances of these problems. These heuristics can be used to find good, if not global, solutions, and appear to work well in practice. We also describe an alternative formulation, based on the perspective transformation, that makes the problem amenable to mixed-integer convex programming and yields computationally tractable lower bounds. We illustrate our heuristic methods by applying them to various examples and use the perspective transformation to certify that the solutions are relatively close to the global optimum.

	abstract="The continuation method is a popular heuristic in computer vision for nonconvex optimization. The idea is to start from a simplified problem and gradually deform it to the actual task while tracking the solution. It was first used in computer vision under the name of graduated nonconvexity. Since then, it has been utilized explicitly or implicitly in various applications. In fact, state-of-the-art optical flow and shape estimation rely on a form of continuation. Despite its empirical success, there is little theoretical understanding of this method. This work provides some novel insights into this technique. Specifically, there are many ways to choose the initial problem and many ways to progressively deform it to the original task. However, here we show that when this process is constructed by Gaussian smoothing, it is optimal in a specific sense. In fact, we prove that Gaussian smoothing emerges from the best affine approximation to Vese's nonlinear PDE. The latter PDE evolves any function to its convex envelope, hence providing the optimal convexification.",

Inspired by previous work, we develop an homotopy algorithm which solves the \ell_1-regularized least square problem for a sequence of decreasing values of the regularization parameter. Compared to the previous method, our algorithm is more efficient in the sense it only updates the solution once for each intermediate problem, and more practical in the sense it has a simple stopping criterion by checking the sparsity of the intermediate solution. Theoretical analysis reveals that our method enjoys a linear convergence rate in reducing the recovery error. Furthermore, our guarantee for recovering the top s elements of the target vector is tighter than previous results, and that for recovering the target vector itself matches the state of the art in compressive sensing.}

	abstract={McCormick's classical relaxation technique constructs closed-form convex and concave relaxations of compositions of simple intrinsic functions. These relaxations have several properties which make them useful for lower bounding problems in global optimization: they can be evaluated automatically, accurately, and computationally inexpensively, and they converge rapidly to the relaxed function as the underlying domain is reduced in size. They may also be adapted to yield relaxations of certain implicit functions and differential equation solutions. However, McCormick's relaxations may be nonsmooth, and this nonsmoothness can create theoretical and computational obstacles when relaxations are to be deployed. This article presents a continuously differentiable variant of McCormick's original relaxations in the multivariate McCormick framework of Tsoukalas and Mitsos. Gradients of the new differentiable relaxations may be computed efficiently using the standard forward or reverse modes of automatic differentiation. Extensions to differentiable relaxations of implicit functions and solutions of parametric ordinary differential equations are discussed. A C++ implementation based on the library MC++ is described and applied to a case study in nonsmooth nonconvex optimization.},

	abstract={A deterministic global optimization method is developed for a class of discontinuous functions. McCormick's method to obtain relaxations of nonconvex functions is extended to discontinuous factorable functions by representing a discontinuity with a step function. The properties of the relaxations are analyzed in detail; in particular, convergence of the relaxations to the function is established given some assumptions on the bounds derived from interval arithmetic. The obtained convex relaxations are used in a branch-and-bound scheme to formulate lower bounding problems. Furthermore, convergence of the branch-and-bound algorithm for discontinuous functions is analyzed and assumptions are derived to guarantee convergence. A key advantage of the proposed method over reformulating the discontinuous problem as a MINLP or MPEC is avoiding the increase in problem size that slows global optimization. Several numerical examples for the global optimization of functions with discontinuities are presented, including ones taken from process design and equipment sizing as well as discrete-time hybrid systems.},

	abstract={Interval branch-and-bound solvers provide reliable algorithms for handling non-convex optimization problems by ensuring the feasibility and the optimality of the computed solutions, i.e. independently from the floating-point rounding errors. Moreover, these solvers deal with a wide variety of mathematical operators. However, these solvers are not dedicated to quadratic optimization and do not exploit nonlinear convex relaxations in their framework. We present an interval branch-and-bound method that can efficiently solve quadratic optimization problems. At each node explored by the algorithm, our solver uses a quadratic convex relaxation which is as strong as a semi-definite programming relaxation, and a variable selection strategy dedicated to quadratic problems. The interval features can then propagate efficiently this information for contracting all variable domains. We also propose to make our algorithm rigorous by certifying firstly the convexity of the objective function of our relaxation, and secondly the validity of the lower bound calculated at each node. In the non-rigorous case, our experiments show significant speedups on general integer quadratic instances, and when reliability is required, our first results show that we are able to handle medium-sized instances in a reasonable running time.},

	abstract={This work addresses the development of an efficient solution strategy for obtaining global optima of continuous, integer, and mixed-integer nonlinear programs. Towards this end, we develop novel relaxation schemes, range reduction tests, and branching strategies which we incorporate into the prototypical branch-and-bound algorithm. In the theoretical/algorithmic part of the paper, we begin by developing novel strategies for constructing linear relaxations of mixed-integer nonlinear programs and prove that these relaxations enjoy quadratic convergence properties. We then use Lagrangian/linear programming duality to develop a unifying theory of domain reduction strategies as a consequence of which we derive many range reduction strategies currently used in nonlinear programming and integer linear programming. This theory leads to new range reduction schemes, including a learning heuristic that improves initial branching decisions by relaying data across siblings in a branch-and-bound tree. Finally, we incorporate these relaxation and reduction strategies in a branch-and-bound algorithm that incorporates branching strategies that guarantee finiteness for certain classes of continuous global optimization problems. In the computational part of the paper, we describe our implementation discussing, wherever appropriate, the use of suitable data structures and associated algorithms. We present computational experience with benchmark separable concave quadratic programs, fractional 0--1 programs, and mixed-integer nonlinear programs from applications in synthesis of chemical processes, engineering design, just-in-time manufacturing, and molecular design.},

We use the McCormick subgradient propagation (Mitsos et al. in SIAM J Optim 20(2):573--601, 2009) to construct simple affine under- and overestimators of each factor of the original factorable function. Then, we minimize and maximize these affine relaxations in order to obtain possibly improved range bounds for every factor resulting in possibly tighter final McCormick relaxations. We discuss the method and its limitations, in particular the lack of guarantee for improvement. Subsequently, we provide numerical results for benchmark cases found in the MINLPLib2 library and case studies presented in previous works, where the McCormick technique appears to be advantageous, and discuss computational efficiency. We see that the presented algorithm provides a significant improvement in tightness and decrease in computational time, especially in the case studies using the reduced space formulation presented in (Bongartz and Mitsos in J Glob Optim 69:761--796, 2017).},

Herein, the composition theorem is generalized to allow multivariate outer functions {\$}{\$}F{\$}{\$}, and theory for the propagation of subgradients is presented. The generalization interprets the McCormick relaxation approach as a decomposition method for the auxiliary variable method. In addition to extending the framework, the new result provides a tool for the proof of relaxations of specific functions. Moreover, a direct consequence is an improved relaxation for the product of two functions, at least as tight as McCormick's result, and often tighter. The result also allows the direct relaxation of multilinear products of functions. Furthermore, the composition result is applied to obtain improved convex underestimators for the minimum/maximum and the division of two functions for which current relaxations are often weak. These cases can be extended to allow composition of a variety of functions for which relaxations have been proposed.},

Given a set of n points in ℝdand given an integer trimming parameter h≤n, LTS involves computing the (d−1)-dimensional hyperplane that minimizes the sum of the smallest h squared residuals. LTS is a robust estimator with a 50 {\%}-breakdown point, which means that the estimator is insensitive to corruption due to outliers, provided that the outliers constitute less than 50 {\%} of the set. LTS is closely related to the well known LMS estimator, in which the objective is to minimize the median squared residual, and LTA, in which the objective is to minimize the sum of the smallest 50 {\%} absolute residuals. LTS has the advantage of being statistically more efficient than LMS. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of LTS is less understood than LMS. In this paper we present new algorithms, both exact and approximate, for computing the LTS estimator. We also present hardness results for exact and approximate LTS.

	abstract={We present an algorithm for the minimization of a nonconvex quadratic function subject to linear inequality constraints and a two-sided bound on the 2-norm of its solution. The algorithm minimizes the objective using an active-set method by solving a series of trust-region subproblems (TRS). Underpinning the efficiency of this approach is that the global solution of the TRS has been widely studied in the literature, resulting in remarkably efficient algorithms and software. We extend these results by proving that nonglobal minimizers of the TRS, or a certificate of their absence, can also be calculated efficiently by computing the two rightmost eigenpairs of an eigenproblem. We demonstrate the usefulness and scalability of the algorithm in a series of experiments that often outperform state-of-the-art approaches; these include calculation of high-quality search directions arising in Sequential Quadratic Programming on problems of the CUTEst collection, and Sparse Principal Component Analysis on a large text corpus problem (70 million nonzeros) that can help organize documents in a user interpretable way.},

	abstract = {Jose L. Walteros and Austin BuchananThis paper focuses on providing a rigorous, worst-case explanation for why the maximum clique problem is apparently so easy in naturally occurring graphs, despite its intractability in the worst case. To this day, there exist unsolved benchmark instances with just 1,000 vertices. In contrast, real-life instances appear to be much easier. Indeed, relatively simple algorithms can solve instances with millions of vertices in just a few seconds. However, these algorithms lack any worst-case guarantees on their running time. Exactly why these real-life instances are so easy has been somewhat of a puzzle. This paper shows that maximum clique can be solved in time polynomial in the size of the graph, but exponential in a graph invariant that we denote by . Typically, is very small for real-life graphs, being 0, 1 or 2 in over half of the instances coming from commonly used testbeds. In these and other cases where can be thought of as a small constant, our algorithm runs in time .To this day, the maximum clique problem remains a computationally challenging problem. Indeed, despite researchers’ best efforts, there exist unsolved benchmark instances with 1,000 vertices. However, relatively simple algorithms solve real-life instances with millions of vertices in a few seconds. Why is this the case? Why is the problem apparently so easy in many naturally occurring networks? In this paper, we provide an explanation. First, we observe that the graph’s clique number ω is very near to the graph’s degeneracy d in most real-life instances. This observation motivates a main contribution of this paper, which is an algorithm for the maximum clique problem that runs in time polynomial in the size of the graph, but exponential in the gap g ≔(d+1)−ω between the clique number ω and its degeneracy-based upper bound d+1. When this gap g can be treated as a constant, as is often the case for real-life graphs, the proposed algorithm runs in time O(dm)=O(m1.5). This provides a rigorous explanation for the apparent easiness of these instances despite the intractability of the problem in the worst case. Further, our implementation of the proposed algorithm is actually practical—competitive with the best approaches from the literature.},

We show that every 3 × 3 essential matrix can be embedded in a 4 × 4 rotation having its bottom right entry fixed to zero; we call the latter the quintessential matrix. This embedding leads to rich relations with the space of 4-D rotations, quaternions, and the classical twisted-pair ambiguity in two-view SfM. We use this structure to derive a succession of semidefinite relaxations that require fewer parameters than the existing non-minimal solvers and yield faster convergence with certifiable optimality. We then exploit the low-rank geometry of these relaxations to reduce them to an equivalent optimization on a Riemannian manifold and solve them via the Riemannian Staircase method. The experimental evaluation confirms that our algorithm always finds the globally optimal solution and outperforms the existing non-minimal methods. We make our implementations open source . 1.},

It is known that convex-set intersection graphs, and also straight-line-segment intersection graphs may have exponentially many maximal cliques. On the other hand, in intersection graphs of homothetic triangles, the maximum number of maximal cliques is polynomial in the number of vertices. We extend the latter result by showing that for every convex polygon P with sides parallel to k directions, every n-vertex graph which is an intersection graph of homothetic copies of P contains at most nk inclusion-wise maximal cliques. We actually prove this result for a more general class of graphs, the so-called kDIR-CONV, which are intersection graphs of convex polygons whose sides are parallel to some fixed k directions. Moreover, we provide lower bounds on the maximum number of maximal cliques and generalize the upper bound to intersection graphs of higher-dimensional convex polytopes in Euclidean space. Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of the polynomial bound on the number of maximal cliques.}

abstract="Motion segmentation is a key underlying problem in computer vision for dynamic scenes. Given 3D data from a RGB-D camera, this paper presents a novel method for motion segmentation without explicitly estimating motions. Building up from a recent literature [1] that proposes a similarity measure between two 3D points belonging to a rigid body, we show that identifying rigid motion groups corresponds to a maximal clique enumeration problem of the similarity graph. Using efficient maximal clique enumeration algorithms we show that it is practically feasible to find all the unique candidate motion groups in a deterministic fashion. We investigate the relationship to traditional hypothesis sampling and show that under certain conditions the inliers to a hypothesis form a clique in the similarity graph. Further, we show that identifying true motions from the candidate motions can be cast as a minimum set cover problem (for outlier-free data) or a max k-cover problem (for data with outliers). This allows us to use the greedy algorithm for max k-cover to segment the motion groups. Presented results using synthetic and real RGB-D data show the validity of our approach.",

The first is a new robust estimator MLESAC which is a generalization of the RANSAC estimator. It adopts the same sampling strategy as RANSAC to generate putative solutions, but chooses the solution that maximizes the likelihood rather than just the number of inliers. The second part of the algorithm is a general purpose method for automatically parameterizing these relations, using the output of MLESAC. A difficulty with multiview image relations is that there are often nonlinear constraints between the parameters, making optimization a difficult task. The parameterization method overcomes the difficulty of nonlinear constraints and conducts a constrained optimization. The method is general and its use is illustrated for the estimation of fundamental matrices, image–image homographies, and quadratic transformations. Results are given for both synthetic and real images. It is demonstrated that the method gives results equal or superior to those of previous approaches.}

We show that many standard graph theoretic problems remain NP-complete on unit disk graphs, including coloring, independent set, domination, independent domination, and connected domination; NP-completeness for the domination problem is shown to hold even for grid graphs, a subclass of unit disk graphs. In contrast, we give a polynomial time algorithm for finding cliques when the geometric representation (circles in the plane) is provided.}
